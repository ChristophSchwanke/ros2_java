ROS2 for Java
-------------

What is this?
-------------

This is a set of projects (bindings, code generator, examples and more) that enables developers to write ROS2
applications for the JVM.

Is this Java only?
------------------

No, any language that targets the JVM can be used to write ROS2 applications.

Including Android?
------------------

Yep! Make sure to use [this fork](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-RTPS/pull/26) as your DDS vendor, it's still not
merged upstream yet.

Sounds great, how can I use this?
----------------------------------

It depends on whether you want to use the desktop
